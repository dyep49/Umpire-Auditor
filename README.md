## Umpire Auditor Application

Project Plan

Scope

After every game, the MLB Gameday API releases a wide variety of information. I plan to build an application that utilizes this API. I intend to iterate through every pitch and calculate whether the umpire made the right call. I intend to have the following functionality:

-Return the worst call of the night, selected by the called strike that was furthest out of the strike zone

-Rank the umpires based on percentage of missed calls

-Rank catchers based on the percentage of missed calls they get

-Display missed call stats for all players and teams

-Allow a user to favorite players, teams, and umpires to more easily track them

-I believe most of these are attainable this week. The biggest challenge I'm facing is seeding the database as the data isn't entirely consistent.



Milestones: 

By the end of...

Monday: Database seeded with errors. Begin work on fixing the data.

Tuesday: Models are established. Data is cleaned up. Work beings on implement the futures and crunching the stats

Wednesday: Main functionality complete. Work on additional features begun.

Thursday: Additional functionality completed and work on front end started and completed.
